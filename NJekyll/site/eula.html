        AWS and Microsoft are not providing the Services and are not responsible for the Services. The Licensee may have other agreements with AWS, Microsoft, or

        applicable). This Agreement will not in any way alter any of the terms or conditions of any other agreement the Licensee may have with AWS or Microsoft for
        its products or services.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.2 Appveyor and any Third-Parties are separate legal entities that are not affiliated with each other, unless otherwise disclosed by Appveyor at its sole
        discretion. This Agreement is between the Licensee and Appveyor. Third-Parties are not providing the Services and are not responsible for the Services. The

        Licensee and the Third-Parties. This Agreement will not in any way alter any of the terms or conditions of any other agreement the Licensee may have with
        any Third-Parties for their products or services.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. LICENSE GRANT, SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND FEES</strong>

    </p>
    <p>
        3.3 During the term of the Beta Release, the Licensed Software and Services will be provided to the Licensee for free and any provisions in this Agreement
        in respect of payments or fees payable to Appveyor for use of the Licensed Software or Services are not applicable to the Beta Release.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.4 During the term of the Beta Release, the Licensed Software and Services will be of a limited functionality and certain services, such as Paid Per

        3.6 The licenses available under the terms of the Commercial Release are subscription-based, and the Subscription Period is monthly. Accordingly, upon
        subscribing for and remitting payment in respect of the Licensed Software, the Licensee will receive the Licensed Software and related Services for a
    period of one (1) calendar month. For further clarity, if a Licensee purchases and remits the associated fees in respect of the Licensed Software on the 15    <sup>th</sup> day of the month, the Licensee will have a valid subscription to the Licensed Software until the 15<sup>th</sup> day of the subsequent month.
        To ensure prompt and continuous delivery of the Licensed Software and Services, the Subscription Period is renewed automatically every month, and the
        Licensee will incur fees, on a recurring-basis, on the last day of their Subscription Period, each and every month, until the Licensee terminates this
        Agreement. The Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time, subject to the terms set out in Section 15 of this Agreement.

        as provided herein.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.8 This Agreement specifically excludes the right to sublicense the Licensed Software or the Services provided thereto. The Licensee shall not permit any
        subsidiaries, affiliated entities, or other third parties to use the Licensed Software unless such entities or individuals agree in writing to be bound by
        the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
    </p>

        Publish Settings. Appveyor will not be responsible for any unauthorized use of the Licensee’s AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, or Windows Azure
        Publish Settings or any charges incurred through unauthorized use. Appveyor may solely and without prejudice to its rights, decide to refuse the Licensee
        access to the Services should the Licensee’s AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, or Windows Azure Publish Settings impersonate another user, or breach
        any trade-mark, other intellectual property right or law, or be vulgar, defamatory or otherwise offensive as determined by Appveyor in its sole discretion.

    <p>
        9.1 Except as reasonably required to exercise its rights under this Agreement, each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any
        unauthorized copying, use, distribution, installation or transfer of possession of Confidential Information. At a minimum, each party shall maintain at

        of its own Confidential Information. A party's Confidential Information shall not include any information which:

    <p>
        9.2 Both parties acknowledge that any use or disclosure of the other party's Confidential Information in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this
        Agreement may cause the non-disclosing party irreparable damage for which remedies other than injunctive relief may be inadequate. Both parties further
        agree that the non-disclosing party shall be entitled to attempt to receive from a court of competent jurisdiction injunctive or other equitable relief to
        restrain such use or disclosure in addition to other appropriate remedies.

    <p>
        <strong>12. BETA RELEASE DISCLAIMER</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        12.1 If the Licensed Software the Licensee receives with this Agreement is a Beta Release, then, to the extent that any provision in this Section is in
        conflict with any other term or condition in this Agreement, this section supersedes such conflicting term(s) and condition(s) as to the Beta Release, but
        only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. The Licensee acknowledges that the Beta Release does not represent the final product from Appveyor,
        and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss. Consequently, Appveyor disclaims any warranty or
        liability obligations to the Licensee of any kind whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
        12.2 Notwithstanding anything set out herein, if the Licensed Software the Licensee receives with this Agreement is a Beta Release, Appveyor may, in its
        sole discretion, terminate or suspend the Licensee’s access to all or part of the Licensed Software or Services at any time, with or without notice, for
        any reason, including, without limitation, breach of this Agreement or any agreement that the Licensee might have with AWS, Microsoft or any Third-Parties.
        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity, or activity that may otherwise affect the
        enjoyment of the Licensed Software, Services or access to the Services by others, may be grounds for termination of the Licensee’s access to all or part of
        the Licensed Software and Services at Appveyor’s sole discretion. Any such termination may, in Appveyor’s sole discretion, include a permanent ban on the
        Licensee’s use of the Licensed Software and Services through any methodology considered appropriate by Appveyor, in its sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        13.1 To the extent permitted by law, in no event will Appveyor, AWS, Microsoft, Third-Parties or any of their respective affiliates, licensees, partners or
        suppliers or the directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives or customers of any of them, be liable for any direct, incidental, punitive,
        exemplary, aggravated, indirect, special or consequential damages, or any other damages of any kind, including but not limited to loss of profits, failure
        to realize expected savings or loss of data, for any cause of action whatsoever and whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal or
        equitable theory arising out of or in any way connected with use of the Licensed Software, Services or Appveyor’s services. Some jurisdictions do not allow
        the limitation of liability for incidental, consequential or other damages so the limitation or exclusion in Section 13 may not apply to all Licensees.
    </p>
    <p>
        13.2 Every exemption from liability, limitation and condition contained in this Agreement for the benefit of Appveyor and every defence and immunity of any
        nature applicable to Appveyor or to which Appveyor is entitled under this Agreement will also be available and will extend to protect each of Appveyor,
        AWS, Microsoft, Third-Parties or any of their respective affiliates, licensees, partners or suppliers or the directors, officers, employees, agents,
        representatives or customers of any of them. For the purpose of all such provisions, Appveyor is and will be deemed to be acting as agent and trustee on
        behalf of and for the benefit of all such persons.
    </p>
    <p>
        13.3 To the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, Appveyor, on behalf of itself and its directors, officers, employees, contractors, developers,
        suppliers and any other related service-providers, disclaims any and all liability for:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages (including loss of profits); and
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) punitive and exemplary damages, arising out of this Agreement or with respect to the installation, implementation, customization, use, operation,
        training, maintenance or support of the Licensed Software, Services, Updates, Upgrades and Supplements, even if Appveyor or its developers or suppliers
        have been apprised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>
    <p>
        13.4 To the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the Licensee agrees that any liability on the part of Appveyor and its suppliers, arising out
        of this Agreement or with respect to the installation, implementation, customization, use, operation or support of the Licensed Software, Services,
        Updates, Upgrades and Supplements shall not exceed the depreciated value of the amount paid by the Licensee in fees for the Licensed Software, Update,
        Upgrade or Supplement which gave rise to such claim. Such depreciation shall be based on straight line depreciation schedule over a period of three (3)
        years.
    </p>
    <p>
        13.5 THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION 13 SHALL APPLY TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONDITION, BREACH OF CONTRACT,
        FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OR ANY OTHER FORM OF BREACH, NEGLIGENCE, OTHER TORT CLAIMS, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>14. TAXES AND TARIFFS</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        14.1 The Licensee shall, besides other amounts payable under this Agreement, pay all Taxes, except for taxes imposed on Appveyor’s income generally, as
        well as customs duties or tariffs, levied or imposed by reason of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, including any new Taxes introduced
        during the term of this Agreement. Concurrently with payment of the applicable fees hereunder, the Licensee shall remit to Appveyor all Taxes due. If any
        Taxes are required to be withheld, then the Licensee shall pay Appveyor an amount such that the net amount after withholding of such Taxes shall equal the
        amount that would have been otherwise payable under this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>15. DEFAULT AND TERMINATION</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        15.1 In the event either party defaults in any material obligation in this Agreement, the other party shall give written notice of such default, and, if
        the party in default has not cured the default within thirty (30) days after the notice, the other party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.
        The Licensee’s failure to pay all amounts due under this Agreement or any Contract Documentation, including but not limited to the Terms of Service, shall
        constitute a default of its material obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
        15.2 Appveyor may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without notice, for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In the event that
        Appveyor terminates this Agreement and the Licensee has remitted fees in respect of the Licensed Software or Services that extends beyond the date of
        termination of this Agreement, Appveyor will return such fees to the Licensee for the unused portion of the Subscription Period that extends beyond the
        date of termination of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
    15.3 The Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, by emailing Appveyor at    <strong>sales@appveyor.com</strong>. In the event that the Licensee exercises its option to terminate this Agreement, Appveyor will not return any fees
        that the Licensee remitted in respect of the Licensed Software or Services, irrespective of whether such fees were remitted in connection with any unused
        portion of the Licensed Software and/or Services that may extend beyond the date of termination of this Agreement or the Licensee’s Subscription Period.
    </p>
    <p>
        15.4 Upon termination of this Agreement, regardless of the cause, the license granted under this Agreement is immediately revoked. Within ten (10) business
        days after the termination of this Agreement, without limiting the foregoing, the Licensee must:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) return to Appveyor or destroy all copies of the Licensed Software in the Licensee's possession; and
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) if asked by Appveyor, deliver a certificate of an officer of that party, if the Licensee is a corporation, or an executed letter if the Licensee is an
        individual, certifying that the same has been completed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Licensee shall continue to be obligated for any payments due as of the date of termination. Termination of the Agreement shall be in addition to, and
        not in lieu of, any other remedies available to Appveyor. Termination shall not relieve either party of their confidentiality obligations as set forth in
        this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>16. INDEMNITY</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        16.1 The Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Appveyor, AWS, Microsoft, their affiliates, licensees, partners and suppliers, and the
        directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and customers of each of them, from:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) any loss or damages, including without limitation actual legal fees, which they may suffer from the Licensee’s activities on or use of the Licensed
        Software or Services, including without limitation any breach by the Licensee of this Agreement or any charges or complaints made by other parties against
        the Licensee, and
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) any claim or demand, including actual legal fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content that the Licensee Posts. The Licensee will
        cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim. Appveyor reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any
        matter otherwise subject to indemnification by the Licensee; provided, however, that the Licensee will remain liable for any such claim and for the costs
        of defense.
    </p>
    <p>
        16.2 Appveyor shall have the right to control the defense of all claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings based on a claim that the Licensed Software or
        Services used within the scope of this Agreement infringes any copyright, patent, or trade secret of a third party. In no event shall the Licensee settle
        any such claim, lawsuit, or proceeding without Appveyor's prior written approval, and Appveyor shall have no liability for any settlement or compromise
        made without its consent. Appveyor shall have no liability for any claim under this Section if said infringement claim is based on the use of a superseded
        or altered version of the Licensed Software or in the event such claim is based upon any modification or enhancement to the Licensed Software made by the
        Licensee or Authorized Users. In the event a third party infringement claim is sustained in a final judgment from which no further appeal is taken or
        possible, or if the Licensee's use of the Licensed Software or Services is enjoined by a court, or if Appveyor believes the Licensed Software or Services
        infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, then Appveyor shall, in its sole election and at its expense either:
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) procure for the Licensee the right to continue to use the Licensed Software and Services pursuant to this Agreement;
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) replace or modify the Licensed Software and Services to make it non-infringing, provided that such replacement or modification does not materially
        decrease the functionality of the Licensed Software or Services; or
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) terminate this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Appveyor agrees to use the option in Section 16.2(c) only in the event that the options in Section 16.2(a) and 16.2(b) are commercially impracticable.
        Appveyor shall have no other liability or obligation to the Licensee except as expressly set forth above.
    </p>
    <p>
        16.3 THIS SECTION STATES THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF APPVEYOR AND ITS SUPPLIERS WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR
        PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>17. COMMUNITY SUPPORT</strong>

        the Licensee may encounter, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred by the Licensee or any other person as a result of the use of any Content Posted
        or otherwise made available through the Community Support. The Community Support is only a forum, and Appveyor, AWS, Microsoft, and any Third-Parties are
        not liable for any statements, representations or Content provided by users.
    </p>
    <p>
        17.3 Appveyor reserves the right, but is not obligated, to monitor any activity and communication within the Services, including but not limited to
        messages, public postings, and other multimedia elements as they become available, to ensure that the Licensee’s use of the Services conforms to the code
        of conduct and other terms of this Agreement. Appveyor may investigate any complaint and suspected or reported violation of this Agreement, including the
        code of conduct, and take any action that it deems appropriate. Such action may include, but is not limited to, issuing warnings, suspension or termination
        of the Licensed Software, Services, and/or removal of Postings and other Content. Appveyor reserves the right and has absolute discretion to remove, screen
        or edit any activity, Content, communication, user profiles, public postings, or messages within the Services that violate this Agreement or are otherwise
        objectionable. Appveyor reserves the right and has absolute discretion to remove, screen or edit any credit card numbers or similar information. In order
        to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas or court orders, to protect systems and customers of Appveyor, AWS, Microsoft, Third-Parties
        and other Licensees or to ensure the integrity and operation of the business and systems of Appveyor, Appveyor may access and disclose any information it
        considers necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, user information, Content, communications, usage history, and Postings.
