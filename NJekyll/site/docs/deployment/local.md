# Integration testing with Local deployment

Local deployment provider deploys artifacts containing web and Windows application packages to build server locally for integration testing. 

## Provider settings

Local deployment provider has exactly the same behavior and configuration settings as [Agent Deployment provider](/docs/deployment/agent) with the only difference is that applications
are being installed locally on the build server.
