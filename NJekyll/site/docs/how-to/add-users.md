# Adding users to your account

Below are instructions on how to add your colleagues from GitHub to AppVeyor account. Please note this method is temporary as we are working on GitHub users import.

1. Go to "Team" page under your account and add new user with real email and set "Generate random password".
2. They will get email notification that they were added to AppVeyor account.
3. Let them login using received email and password, not GitHub button.
4. After they login they go to their Profile (https://ci.appveyor.com/profile) and link their GitHub account.
5. After that they can use GitHub button to login.
