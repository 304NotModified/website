                    AppVeyor has built-in NuGet feeds with project artifacts.
                    Every account comes with a private password-protected NuGet feed which aggregates packages from all projects and enables publishing of your custom packages.
                    Projects have separate NuGet feeds with all NuGet packages pushed as artifacts.

                    Build artifacts are stored in a highly-durable Geo-redundant cloud storage and always available to your team through AppVeyor web interface or API.
                    Easily <a href="/docs/packaging-artifacts" target="_blank">control the artifacts</a> that must be collected during the build
                    or rely on <a href="/docs/build-phase">automatic packaging</a> of well-known Visual Studio project types such as Web Application and Azure Cloud Service.

                    Get results faster for large projects. AppVeyor can drastically reduce overall build time by allowing you to split tests into groups by categories,
                    assemblies or custom criteria and run them as build jobs in parallel. Visual Studio tests, NUnit, xUnit and custom runners are supported.
